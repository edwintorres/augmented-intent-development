# Augmented Intent Development (AID)

In a world rushing toward unchecked automation, **AID keeps humans at the center.  
Humans set intent, AI augments it.**

We choose to evolve from Agile’s value of *“working software over comprehensive documentation”* to a new 
foundation: *“intent specification over improvised code generation.”*

---

## What We Value

- **Human judgment and creativity over unchecked automation**  
- **Concise intent specification over exhaustive documentation**  
- **Validated specifications over unchecked assumptions** 
- **Code and tests from specifications over improvised implementation**
- **Scaling through tests over scaling through code**  
- **Repeatable patterns over one-off hacks**

---

## Why Now?

AI can generate code faster than humans can review it. Without structure, we drown in output. Without intent, we generate the wrong things. AID provides the framework to harness AI's speed while preserving human judgment, context, and creative direction.

## Core Principles of Augmented Intent Development

### The Process
1. **Human-driven by design** — humans set intent, AI augments it.  
2. **Specify intent first** — every cycle begins with intent captured clearly in specifications.
3. **Validate through iteration** —  specifications are refined with humans and AI models until clear, sound, and proven.
4. **Tests anchor intent** — specifications define tests; tests enable safe scaling.
5. **Code comes last** — implementation follows validated specifications and established tests.

### The Guardrails
6. **Structure preserves context** — without it, intent collapses and code drifts.
7. **Collaboration prevents reality drift** — isolation creates unchecked assumptions and blind spots.
8. **Simplicity matters** — the best specifications guide clearly without overwhelming.  
9. **Shared language** — write every artifact once to serve both humans and AI.

✦ *As humans, we follow this methodology to keep our intent at the center.*  
✦ *We choose clarity, structure, and repeatable patterns over blind automation, bloated documentation, and one-off hacks.*  
✦ *This is how AI aids humans in building better software: by amplifying intent, not replacing judgment.*
